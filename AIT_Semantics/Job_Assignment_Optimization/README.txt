This is my solution using Prolog for one of the coding puzzles given by APT at :

	http://www.predictivetechnologies.com/careers/puzzles/the-perfect-job.aspx


Task :  Given list of people, their personalities and job assignments as well as their relationship status,
the program finds the optimal assignment that maximizes the total utility.

Directions : 
	Use the supplied Java code to parse the inputs.
	Change the corresponding lines in PerfectJobFinal to get created files as sources.
	Consult the code in SICStus Prolog and run. The program will print out the optimal assignment
	and the achieved utility.
